Established and managed the first community of makers who used IFTTT. Documented and developed case studies to determine how IFTTT’s products could evolve to better match the demand of IOT and affiliated systems. Included is a selected set of work.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>During my two month contract with IFTTT I worked with the Platform team and Marketing team to research a new tool which was being released to makers called the Maker Platform. The tools was a variant of what was offered to IFTTT partners like Nest, Microsoft, etc. with a few modifications. The goal was to research the product with an alpha and beta testing community as it was in active development.</p>

<h1 id="research">Research</h1>

<p>During the research phase I conducted research interviews to determine how makers, individuals who created their own Applets on ifttt.com, currently used the platform and what we could do to allow them to make even more awesome Applets. After interviewing participants over a course of a few weeks I created a research readout to act as a summary of findings form internal and external user research, secondary research, FullStory sessions, and ongoing community engagement with the Maker Platform Beta. Below I have included selected assets from the research.</p>

<h3 id="evolutionofiftttformula">Evolution of IFTTT FORMULA</h3>

<p>Many alternatives to IFTTT have focused on features as IFTTT has focused on building a network of services users love. This particular project focused on providing and building some of “expected features” back into the IFTTT platform.  There was a need to highlight the evolution of the IFTTT formula as part of the research identified a need to contextualize where the IF This Then That formula started and where it is going in order to understand the needed infrastructure to support users. <br>

<h3 id="anatomyofanapplet">Anatomy of an Applet</h3>

<p>Applets can be thought of in four levels of complexity and three ways of manipulation. <br>
<img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2017/07/Anatomy-of-Applet-2d.png" alt="IFTTT"></p>

<p><strong>Layer One</strong> - Summary of the function of the Applet</p>

<p><strong>Layer Two</strong> - Summary of the function and the state of the Applet</p>

<p><strong>Layer Three</strong> - Selector for customizations and notifications</p>

<p><strong>Layer Four</strong> - Composition layer where you can create Applets using Triggers, Filters, and Actions</p>

<h1 id="build">Build</h1>

<p>Phase two focused on building out the next version of the Maker platform. This was broken into building out the documentation for the new Applet Composer, a Maker community and a new Maker profile.</p>

<li>Creating a chatbot interface for IFTTT and its partner services.</li>
<li>IFTTT as an OAuth authenticator for non-screen based devices.</li>
<li>IFTTT as the operating system for your home.</li>

<img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/02/0Ad9yHP8QdCYBUqKxoiw_Stockholmsnow.jpg" alt="Data Emissions"><p>I have vivid memories <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkM6RJf15cg">growing up</a> of battling <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Covenant_Species">the covenant</a> online in halo and video chatting with family across the country. Over time this love has perpetually grown as my bandwidth has increased from 64KB/s to 120MB/s. Recently, I have taken my data footprint to a new scale by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/online-tv-stream-price-guide">cutting the cord</a> and automating my life with services like <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes">IFTTT</a> and <a href="https://evernote.com/?var=c">Evernote</a>. Despite all of this joy between the internet and me, we have an unhealthy relationship and we need to have an intervention.</p>

<h2 id="thecostof">The cost of ♥️.</h2>

<p>There have been two major events causing me to question my relationship with the internet. One has been my coursework at California College of the Arts that addresses various aspects of sustainability. The second has been reading the May 2015 Greenpeace <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/#report">Click Clean Report</a>, which focuses on evaluating the nation's largest data centers based on the methods they use to power themselves.</p>

<iframe width="512px" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOlDksjdATg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I began to connect the dots. Sure, driving a car has an impact. We even rate them based on mpg. But what could the effect of all this data really be on our wonderful little planet?</p>

<p>Where do I even start? Let's begin with T-Mobile, my cellular provider. It turns out the iPhone automatically tracks my data usage down to the application. So, for my current roaming period I have used about 40GB. But what is the impact of the 40GB?</p>

<p><img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/04/Group.png" alt="Data Emissions"></p>

<p>Next, I investigated how much I use at home which should be the bulk of my usage. My Internet Service Provider (ISP), Comcast, also tracks that for me. Now I wanted to average these numbers being that September was exceptionally high which would bring my average usage to 3,300GB per month. So how many pounds of CO2 are released on average for 1 GB of data?</p>

<p><img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/04/1-tWz-IGVO3o-If9JLkpeNhg.png" alt="Data Emissions"></p>

<h2 id="gigabytestoco2">Gigabytes to CO2</h2>

<p>I don’t know that we can be faulted for our addiction to the internet but we need to be made more aware of the impact. Yes, there are many ways in which the internet contributes to our society. Sociologically speaking products like Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat have redefined how we communicate with each other as humans. Economically, Google, Amazon, and Kickstarter have changed how we purchase products from anywhere in the world. Yet, ecologically we need to grapple with the environmental impact of the internet and make clear improvements. I read an article by <a href="http://www.justinsecor.com/#/">Justin Secor</a> called <a href="https://medium.com/@secor/the-web-is-inefficient-but-we-can-fix-it-b64d9634e0b2#.wod3pvjuy"><em>The Web is inefficient, but we can fix it</em></a> and calculated the impact 1GB of data had in terms of CO2 assuming that all data centers are created equal. My findings were that 1GB of hosted data creates about 2 lbs of CO2 per month released into the atmosphere.</p>

<p><em>1 GB = 2 LBS CO2</em></p>

<p>Given that my cumulative monthly data usage is 40GB+3,300GB= 3,340GB that would mean that I aid in generating <a href="http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=667&amp;t=2">6,680lbs CO2 per month</a> on average. This suggests that my digital footprint pollutes about 80,160 lbs CO2 per year.</p>

<h2 id="a">A 💔</h2>

<p>The idea of our data living in the ‘cloud’ is a positive though misleading metaphor. That’s not the reality in which we live. All of those little bytes streaming through fiberoptic cables across the globe to get us the new Adele song do have a quantifiable cost beyond your monthly bill.  </p>

<p>I want to maintain my relationship with the internet but we need to push for more stringent requirements in evaluating these data centers and the products which they host. <a href="http://greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace</a>, for the last couple of years, has begun to evaluate data centers and give them a grade based on their Transparency, Energy Efficiency &amp; Mitigation, Renewable Energy Deployment &amp; Advocacy, and Renewable Energy Commitment &amp; Siting Policy. <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/leed">LEED</a> also certifies data centers, but only certifies the building itself. We need to go further, we must go futher. When the time comes for economics to push for a sustainable means of running data centers it will be too late. We cannot wait until we are out of coal or petroleum. We need to act now.</p>

<h2 id="anintervention">An Intervention</h2>

<p>I am not going to stop using the internet, nor is it realistic to think that we should, but there is a necessary level of awareness and action that needs to be taken to prevent our consumption from ravaging our planet. We need to make it more sustainable by setting standards by which we can regulate data centers now and in the future. A portion of this advancement will naturally happen because of routine developments in technology; however, we still need to put standards in place to help propel future technologies in the right direction. </p>

<p>Sustainability always becomes more complicated then I anticipate. So naturally my current project in "IxD 5: Sustainability" discovered that one of the most difficult parts was simply describing the ecosystem surounding my topic, data. I think this is partially due to the misleading notion that our ‘data’ lives in the ‘cloud’. So I created this simplified flow to breakdown how data flows from the data center to your device.</p>

<p><strong>Concept Feedback</strong></p>

<p>It would be nice if the organization did not turn into just another government entity (It is not clear if you are proposing that it would or wouldn’t be.)</p>

<p>We are still run like a start up so we are scrappy which means the cheapest and best MVP wins overtime.</p>

<p>Our culture cares about being aware of how we make an impact, but we are still driven by the need to make enough money to survive.</p>

<p>Looking at the breakdown, we would definitely fit into the current means of evaluation. My fear is that as we begin to scale and take on companies like Amazon, we will continue to be scrappy but will fail of the proposed regulations because we are the underdog trying to take on a behemoth.</p>

<p>Could you add a category for legacy hardware. (We recycle our old drives and reuse the hardware.)</p>

<p><strong>Future Points of Influence.</strong></p>

<p>The only reason we would be inclined is because we are small and scrappy so portions of your proposal already fit in our current work flow.</p>

<p>Backblaze would heavily judge if they wanted to participate based on the other companies validating or backing the program. If this is a LEED extension program for example, we might be more inclined.</p>

<p>Could this platform focus more on showcasing good practices so we can use our collective knowledge to build better data facilities.</p>

<p>Think of it as crowd sourcing knowledge.</p>

<p>Crowd sourcing knowledge could create an expectation for better standards in terms of influence. In the beginning other companies thought Backblaze was cheating because no one thought of a way to optimize storage because no one could understand we were charging what we were and actually making money.</p>

<h1 id="research">RESEARCH</h1>

<p>During the Summer of 2014 a team of interns (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jicorrea">Juan Correa</a>, <a href="http://rucha-patwardhan.squarespace.com">Rucha Patwardhan</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.williamfelker.com">William Felker</a>) worked on researching how we could make Intel's Galileo more approachable to novice makers. We were a part of Intel Labs User Experience Research Group and more specifically, the Open Design Research Team. Our goal was to deliver a comprehensive research summary of the space surrounding Galileo and a final prototype of our recommended solution. Our team conducted a comprehensive research phase focusing on building a comprehensive ecosystem surrounding the Galileo to enable it to become an educational platform for individuals new to the maker space.</p>

<h1 id="prototyping">PROTOTYPING</h1>

<p>We explored a variety of concepts stemming from modular self-building kits to making smarter breadboards that one could control with an app. Ultimately, we narrowed it down to two main streams of thought. One explored the value gained by reverse engineering something and the second investigated building from scratch in a 'safe' environment.</p>

  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align:top">This concept spawned from the idea that many kids will disassemble things as an attempt to understand how they work.  To test this hypothesis we built a 'Bee' that was constructed of mini modules that can be taken apart and put back together in a different order to make a new object. For this iteration the Bee's eyes light up when you touched its wings.</td>
    <td style="vertical-align:top">Next, we explored the ideas surrounding a toolkit that would make it safe to "blow something up" as you learn about the relationships between sensors and actuators. The goal of this concept was to focus on a more guided experience and to leave the user with a kit of components which they can use to start making their first project.</td>

<h1 id="learnings">LEARNINGS</h1>

<p>After several rounds of user testing, we chose to focus on the Guided Experience. This was predominantly due to the feedback we received on our two concepts. From here we created a set of design principles which we felt would enable a novice maker to become successful.</p>

<li><strong>Generative</strong> | It should multiply the possibilities for making. It should be FUN and spark imagination.</li>
<li><strong>Quick + Rich</strong> | It takes away the complexity of building circuits to allow for making. It does not limit the range of creations the maker can build.</li>

    <td style="vertical-align:top">Next we wanted to understand how novice makers experience the relationships between sensors and actuators. We thought this could be achieved through the introduction of a working circuit which could be used as the Galileo booted up. At that point the next flap of the box would open revealing a collection of different sensors and actuators to exchange with the working circuit. 
We discovered that there is a preconceived affordance: when kids saw an open box, they wanted to open all of the flaps at once as opposed to following the sequence of steps that would teach them about sensors and actuators. This instinctive response disrupted the flow of the experience.

    <td style="vertical-align:top">The goal of the next iteration was to solidify the proper flow to better understand the best method for introducing the relationship between hardware and software. Similar discoveries arose reflecting that we did not fully resolve the issues from version 2. This forced us to radically shift the intended flow of our box by turning the box into a mini toolbox and workstation which immediately exposed all the components.</td>
    <td style="vertical-align:top">Now that we understood that there was a greater need to focus on creating an environment which reduced complexity and encouraged play, we streamlined the box, changed our color coding systems to show the relationship between sensors and actuators, and redesigned a shield that we had been using since version 3 that allowed you to interact with Galileo through a customized mini pig tail connector.
This greatly reduced the level of fear that users had about interacting with components that they had never used before and enabled a safe environment in which they could explore sensors and actuators. To achieve this, we removed the software component temporarily in the hopes of bringing it back in a 5th version. This would enable greater flexibility with the kit by being able to reprogram the Galileo itself.</td>

<h1 id="nextsteps">NEXT STEPS</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Software vs Hardware</strong> | In order to further develop the full potential of our final concept, we needed to expand our user testing sessions to incorporate a wider user demographic. The initial users tested tended to lean towards individuals who had an interest in pursuing some form of technology-based learning. </li>
<li><strong>Beyond the Classroom</strong> | Most of our research was conducted within learning environments that were geared towards teaching kids about technology. In order to fully understand the depth of the maker environment, we would need to test the kit in a wider variety of environments to understand how to best support the user when they do not have access to technology.</li>
<li><strong>Better Software Integration</strong> | Based on our preliminary research, our goal shifted to simplify the learning process which resulted in our team removing the <a href="https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/ConnectAnyThing">Connect Anything</a> (CAT_v2) platform from the toolkit. Looking at reintegrating CAT would enable us to better understand what it is that allows connections to be drawn between the software and hardware prototyping worlds.</li>

<h1 id="research">RESEARCH</h1>

<p>Memory is a tricky thing. It is fragile, robust, and meaningful. We often lack appreciation of memories in the moment, only to find them important in the years ahead. These reasons are part of what motivated me to examine how we could use a garment to expand and share our memory. The process for this project was heavily inspired by the relationship that I have with my grandparents who used to live in California where I currently reside. I realized I knew very little about when they lived here and what they did. When I started exploring memory, I immediately recalled a talk that I heard from Wilson Miner from the Build 2011 conference in which he discusses objects being vessels for memory.</p>

<p>As I researched the meaning behind objects, curiosity was sparked in the relationship between heirlooms and totems. These are often the names we give to belongings that are more meaningful to us than everyday objects. They are the things that we keep near and the things that help us remember. </p>

<p>There is a special relationship in how we interact with these objects. Some we keep safely locked away, some we cannot help but hold near, and often they help us to share stories of the past with others.</p>

<h1 id="designprinciples">DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h1>

<p><strong>Warmth</strong> - The final form should convey the feeling of snuggling up with a good book next to a warm fire.</p>

<p><strong>Safe and Secure</strong> - The garment should create a safe-feeling user environment.</p>

<p><strong>Intimate</strong> - The experience should enable a level of intimacy in order to allow the wearer to reflect on personal moments without judgement.</p>

<p><strong>Handmade</strong> - The craft behind the garment should have a story, both to act as a starting point for the keeping of memories but also to showcase the handmade craft that adds character to an object.</p>

<p><strong>Personal</strong> - The garment should act as a totem, something that holds particular meaning to that individual and something that he or she feels can be passed along to other specific individuals, but not just anybody.</p>

<h1 id="prototypes">PROTOTYPES</h1>

One of the first concepts combined audio recording with geo location by embedding them both into a scarf. This scarf could be switched between modes. The modes include a record mode or explore mode.</p>

<p><img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/04/IXDSN-350-02_Prjct_03_Final-016.png" alt="Memory Scarf"></p>

<p>The second iteration focused on a scarf-hoodie combination in which the same two modes would exist and would be linked to the hood being up and the hood being down. The shift in form was primarily due to trying to amplify the feeling of warmth and intimacy by creating an environment which allowed you to feel semi-isolated anywhere.</p>

<p><img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/04/IXDSN-350-02_Prjct_03_Final-017-1.png" alt="Memory Scarf"></p>

<p>After testing both variations of the muslin prototypes and interviewing individuals on the surrounding eco-systems, I determined that the ability to record based on location did not need to be combined; rather, the functions should be able to work independently of one another. Although the ability to receive information based on a specific location still interests me, my focus shifted to honing the experience between recording and playing back audio. This way the focus can be drawn to the meaning behind the content.</p>

<hr>

<h1 id="nextsteps">NEXT STEPS</h1>

<p>Explore possibility for a surrounding ecosystem. <br>
Consider what other forms of technology could be used more subtly and effectively. <br>
Try varying the triggering mechanisms for recording and playing back. <br>
Conduct additional user testing to determine best methods for interacting with content beyond sound.</p>

<h1 id="research">RESEARCH</h1>

<p>Radio today has shifted dramatically from what it once was. In the beginning radio was purely meant to be used as a communication tool.  From there it evolved into one of the main ways we listened to music and learned about the news as families would gather around to listen. Once radio was replaced by the television, it found a new home in our cars and for a brief time even on our phones. Since then, radio has taken many forms, including apps for public radio stations, billboard chart lists, YouTube shows and Podcasts.  Today, radio is in the midst of rebranding its identity. Given the expansion of radio in multiple forms, I wanted to explore what it would mean to (re)personalize the radio while taking it back to its roots of storytelling in a communal setting.  </p>

<h2 id="learnings">LEARNINGS</h2>

<p><strong>Media</strong> - Media should manage itself; you should not be managed by media.
<strong>Form</strong> - The content should be customized for the end user.
<strong>The Broadcast</strong> - The speaker should require so little interaction that it operates independently.
<strong>The Object</strong> - The object should reflect the personality of the individual but not distract from the content.</p>

<h1 id="prototyping">PROTOTYPING</h1>

<h2 id="prototype01">PROTOTYPE 01</h2>

<p>The first iteration focused on creating a form which was mobile enough that you could take it to a room for a party but large enough that it was not practical to take out of a house. The end shape was too cumbersome to reflect the main control mechanism to rotate the device in order to change broadcasts.</p>

<h2 id="prototype02">PROTOTYPE 02</h2>

<p><img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/04/Prjct06_OOBE_Master_v1-025.png" alt="Atmosphere"></p>

<p>The second iteration was primarily an exploration of form in which the device could comfortably be rotated with one hand. </p>

<h2 id="prototype03">PROTOTYPE 03</h2>

<p><img src="http://williamfelker.com/content/images/2016/04/Prjct06_OOBE_Master_v1-029.png" alt="Atmosphere"></p>

<p>Prototype number 3 was another refinement of the physical volume of the device as well as determining the proper weight and textures to refine the control mechanisms.</p>

<h1 id="nextsteps">NEXT STEPS</h1>

<ul>
<li>Explore a wider variation of forms.</li>
<li>Complete a deep dive into a second round of research specifically on how people consume audio based media content.</li>
<li>Investigate how communal conversation can be generated around the syncing of the broadcasting of the device among multiple users or by altering the methods of content distribution. </li>
</ul>
